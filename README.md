## 1. What is React?

**React** is an **open-source JavaScript library** used to build **user interfaces**, especially for **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**.  
It was created by **Jordan Walke**, a software engineer at **Facebook**.  
React was first deployed on Facebook's **News Feed** in **2011**, and later on **Instagram** in **2012**.

## 2. What are the major features of React JS?

- Uses **JSX syntax**, which allows writing **JavaScript inside HTML**, making the code more readable and intuitive.
- Utilizes a **Virtual DOM** instead of manipulating the **Real DOM**, improving performance.
- Supports **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, which helps with **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**.
- Follows a **unidirectional data flow** (also known as **one-way data binding**), making data management more predictable.
- Encourages the use of **reusable UI components**, which speeds up development and ensures consistency.

## 3. What is JSX?

**JSX** stands for **JavaScript XML**.  
It's a syntax extension to **JavaScript** that allows writing **HTML-like code** within React components.  
JSX is supported by **ECMAScript (ES)** standards and makes the code more expressive and easier to write.

### ‚úÖ With JSX:
```jsx
const myElement = <h1>React is {5 + 5} times better with JSX</h1>;
```

### ‚ùå Without JSX:
```js
const myElement = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  null,
  "React is " + (5 + 5) + " times better with JSX"
);
```

## 4. What is the difference between Element and Component?

#### **Element**  
- A Element is a **plain JavaScript object** describing what should appear on the screen.  
- It Represents a **virtual DOM node** (e.g., HTML tag or component instance).  
- Element is a **Immutable** object (cannot be changed after creation).  
- Created using `React.createElement()` or **JSX**:  
  ```jsx
  const element = <div id="login-btn">Login</div>;
  ```
- **Structure**:  
  ```js
  {
    type: 'div',
    props: { 
      id: 'login-btn',
      children: 'Login' 
    }
  }
  ```

#### **Component**  
- A **function or class** that accepts `props` and returns a **React element tree (JSX)**.  
- It is **Reusable** and **composable (Mutable)**.  
- **Two types**:  
  1. **Function Component**:  
     ```jsx
     const Button = ({ handleLogin }) => (
       <div id="login-btn" onClick={handleLogin}>Login</div>
     );
     ```  
  2. **Class Component**:  
     ```jsx
     class Button extends React.Component {
       render() {
         return <div id="login-btn" onClick={this.props.handleLogin}>Login</div>;
       }
     }
     ```

## 5. How to create components in React?

There are two type of component declaration: 
### **i. Function Components**  
Simplest way to create a **stateless** component:  
```jsx
function Greeting({ message }) {
  return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>;
}
```

### **ii. Class Components**  
Used for **stateful** components or lifecycle methods:  
```jsx
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>;
  }
}
```

## 6. When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?
After the addition of **hooks** in functional component it is always recommended to use **functional component** over **class component** in React. Because you could use **State**, **lifecycle methods** and other features that were only available in class components it is also now available in functional component.

But even their are two reasons to use class component over functional components.

i.) If you need a React functionality whose functional component is not equivalent to the level of class components, in this scenario you can use class component over functional component.

ii.) Class components are used for maintain backward compatability. 
## Summary:

### Use functional component:
- If you don't need state or lifecycle methods.
- For **simplicity**, **readablity**, and need to follow **modern code practices**, especially with the use of **React Hooks** for state management and side effects etc. You can go for functional component.

### Use Class component:
- If you need to manage state or need to use **lifecycle methods**. you can go for class components
- Class components are used for maintain backward compatability. 
- Some advanced **error handling** scenarios (using Error Boundaries)

### Evolution of Components in React

#### Class Components
```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }
  
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('Component mounted');
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

#### Function Components with Hooks
```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component mounted');
  }, []);

  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
